            <p>This recipe takes very little prep time and makes amazing artisan bread loaves. 
                If you want to be a bit more adventurous, try adding herbs to the bread or sprinkling 
                something on top of the loaf before baking.</p>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Make sure the water is lukewarm.</strong> Technically, this recipe will work with cold water, 
                    but you'll need significantly more rising time - 4 or 5 hours at least.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Add yeast and salt to the water</strong> in a large (at least 5 quart) bowl or food-grade 
                    bucket, preferably with a lid. Don't worry about dissolving everything.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Mix in the flour</strong> all at once. You'll want to measure the flour by scooping and 
                    sweeping the excess off the top; don't compact the flour. You can mix with a wooden spoon, food processor 
                    with at least 14 cups capacity, or a sturdy stand mixer with a dough hook. I use a wooden spoon, personally. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Once the dough is uniformally moist, without dry patches, it's time to let it rise.</strong> Cover 
                    the dough with a lid or a towel, and make sure the lid isn't airtight - using a sealed jar or similar could 
                    result in a small explosion, and no one wants to clean dough and broken glass off the walls. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Allow dough to rise at room temperature until it begins to collapse or flatten at the top,</strong>
                    generally around two hours. You can allow it to rise up to five hours without compramising the recipe. After 
                    the dough rises, you can refridgerate it until you're ready to bake.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Cloak and shape the dough, no kneeding necesssary.</strong> First, you want to prep a "pizza peal" - 
                    sprinkle cornmeal on the baking surface. Then, with floured hands, shape about a pound of dough into each loaf, 
                    "cloaking" the loaf by stretching the surface of the dough around to the bottom on all sides. The seam produced 
                    by cloaking should be facing down on your baking surface.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Allow the dough to rest</strong> for about 40 minutes, and <strong>preheat the oven to 450Â°F</strong>
                    about 20 minutes before baking.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>When it's time to bake, sprinkle flour on the dough and slash</strong> the top of each loaf 2-4 times 
                    with the tip of a very sharp knife. The slashes should be about 1/4 inch deep.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>When the oven is preheated, put an oven-safe bowl of water on the lower rack</strong> of the oven. This 
                    will produce steam as the loaves bake. <strong>Place the baking surface with the loaves on the middle rack</strong> 
                    of the oven.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Bake the loaves for about 30 minutes,</strong> or until the crust is nice and brown and firm to the touch.
                    You can also knock on a loaf and listen for a sort of hollow sound to be sure it's baked through. Remove from the 
                    oven and allow to cool before serving.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>If you have leftover dough,</strong> you can store it in the fridge for up to 14 days. 
                </li>
