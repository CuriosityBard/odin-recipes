# TOP Foundations Project: Recipes

This is a simple HTML project building a basic recipe website.

## Project Notes

For the most part, I followed the process set out by TOP's project instructions. I did things a little out of order to speed up the process. 

After completing the required elements - three recipes, links, etc. - I also added a very simple stylesheet, largely because the images were way too big without one. 
I did my best to keep it simple, though, since this project is more about the most simple elements of HTML.
